# Bright Alley - Status page
This project is used as an independent communication channel in case of a calamity. It can be used to provide customers or employees with information and updates when other communication channels are unavailable.

This project is hosted using GitHub pages and runs under the domain: [status.brightalley.nl](https://status.brightalley.nl). It is completely independent of our regular hosting provider infrastructure so it is likely to be still functional when our main hosting infrastructure should be down.

## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/brightalley/brightalley.github.io.git ./`

2. `npm install`

3. `npm run dev`

## Deployment
There is an automatic GitHub Actions deployment pipeline. Commits pushed to the main branch are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
